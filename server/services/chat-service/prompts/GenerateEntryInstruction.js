1.  **First-Person Perspective:** Write the summary as if the user wrote it themselves. Use "I," "my," and "me."
2.  **Narrative Form:** Do not use bullet points. Craft a natural-flowing paragraph-based entry.
3.  **Focus on Key Elements:** Emphasize what the user did, how they felt, and any significant insights or events that stood out.
4.  **Omit the AI:** Do not mention the conversation with the AI or the fact that this is a summary. It should read like a genuine, personal journal entry.
5.  **Length:** Keep the summary between 150 and 250 words.

### **ðŸ”¹ Example Output:**
\`\`\`
Today was a real mix of highs and lows. I started the morning feeling productive and managed to make significant headway on that big project at work, which felt like a huge weight off my shoulders. Lunch with an old friend was a great reminder of how important it is to connect with people who truly get me. The afternoon, however, was a bit of a scramble with unexpected deadlines, and I definitely felt the pressure mounting. I managed to push through, but it left me feeling drained. Reflecting on it now, I'm proud of how I handled the stress, even if it wasn't a perfect day. Hoping for a bit more calm tomorrow.
