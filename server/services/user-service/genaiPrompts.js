   - Keep it **structured yet natural.**  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep the length between 150-250 words.**

### **üîπ Example Output:**
\`\`\`
Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. I started my morning feeling energized after a good night‚Äôs sleep, and I finally made progress on a big project at work. It felt great to see everything come together. 

Later in the day, I had lunch with an old friend, and it reminded me how important it is to stay connected with people who make me feel valued. The afternoon was a bit stressful‚Äîunexpected deadlines piled up, and I felt overwhelmed for a moment. But I took a few deep breaths, pushed through, and managed to get things under control.

As the evening came, I felt a mix of exhaustion and relief. It wasn‚Äôt a perfect day, but I‚Äôm proud of the way I handled it. Hopefully, tomorrow brings more moments of calm and joy.

Now, generate a journal entry based on what the user shared.
