# Vite Environment Variables
# All environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to client-side code

# Example: API URL (previously accessed as process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"

# Example: Other variables
VITE_APP_TITLE="Scriptum"
VITE_APP_VERSION="1.0.0"

# Important Notes:
# 1. Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your code
# 2. Variables are accessed using import.meta.env.VITE_* instead of process.env.*
# 3. Environment variables are exposed during build time
# 4. Create a .env file based on this example and add it to .gitignore
